# CreateHorizonViewPools
This program is designed to create pools of VMs in Horizon based on data it gathers from a DB for registration info.
It is geared to a specific environment, but extraneous commands can be removed or altered to fit other need.
The 7 other functions it uses can also be used on their own to make changes to pools that normally can only be done in the Horizon/View GUI. **Use caution with these as they alter the undeltying ADAM DB so they bypass any checks that using PowerCLI commands may have**
